1. Select all payees (vendors or employees) that you would like to send an invitation to for collecting payment details. You can filter on this page using the search bar above the table. Click **Next** after making your selections. Optionally, [Advanced Import Options](https://docs.squareworks.com/squareworks-automate/automate-configuration/payment-automation#id-8.-importing-payees) may be used to import existing ACH and check payment methods.

Only active vendors and employees appear in the list below if they have not already been imported. Employees with the Administrator role are not able to be invited as payees.

1. Repeat for any additional payment batches necessary.

#### ACH Reconciliation Using Bank Match Data <a href="#ach-reconciliation-using-bank-match-data" id="ach-reconciliation-using-bank-match-data"></a>

NetSuite provides a native reconciliation tool, Bank Match Data, which can be used to reconcile ACH debits and credits directly within your bank account records. Since ACH debits in SquareWorks Automate are batched into a single transaction covering multiple ACH credits, two key identifiers help with reconciliation:

1. Transaction ID (Generated by Automate)
   * This ID is generated immediately when a payment batch is created in SquareWorks Automate and is available in Payee Payments > Payment History after release.
   * The Transaction ID follows a structured format to indicate batch grouping. The format for Transaction ID is as follows`<Optional Prefix>-<Transaction Number>-<Credit-Identifier>`. For example:
     * ABC-123-1 and ABC-123-2 belong to the same batch.
     * ABC-124-1 would belong to a different batch.
     * The Transaction ID is always available immediately for reference.
     * The optional prefix is set at the Business Entity level.
2. ACH ID (Assigned by the ACH Network)
   * This ID is not generated immediately and may take time to be assigned by the ACH networks.
   * Once assigned, it is appended to the Transaction Memo of each individual transaction record in NetSuite.
   * The ACH ID on the is shared across all associated credits and debits transactions, serving as a batch identifier.

**Using Bank Match Data in NetSuite**

To reconcile ACH transactions using Bank Match Data, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Bank Match Data
   * Go to Transactions > Bank > Bank Match Data in NetSuite.
   * The tool displays:
     * Debits (left side): Pulled from the bank statement via the automated bank feed.
     * Credits (right side): Individual vendor payments recorded in NetSuite.
2. Find Transactions Using Identifiers
   * Search using the ACH ID or Transaction ID to locate all related ACH credits and the corresponding ACH debit.
   * Depending on the bank, either the Transaction ID or the ACH ID will be displayed in the bank transaction memo.
   * In Bank Match Data:
     * Debits (left hand side)
       * The memo will contain either the ACH ID or the Transaction ID in the memo column
     * Credits (right hand side)
       * The ACH ID appears in the Memo column.
       * The Transaction ID appears in the Tran. No column.
3. Match and Reconcile Transactions
   * Select the matching transactions:
     * Debits on the left (imported from the bank statement).
     * Credits on the right (payments recorded in NetSuite).
   * Search credits using either the Transaction ID or ACH ID
     * Select all credits associated to the batch
   * Click Match to reconcile the credits to the corresponding debit.

By leveraging both Transaction ID and ACH ID, you can ensure that SquareWorks Automate payments align seamlessly with bank records, maintaining accuracy in financial reconciliation.

### Frequently Asked Questions <a href="#frequently-asked-questions" id="frequently-asked-questions"></a>

#### How long does it take for payments to reach my payee? <a href="#how-long-does-it-take-for-payments-to-reach-my-payee" id="how-long-does-it-take-for-payments-to-reach-my-payee"></a>

Standard ACH payments can take between 4-5 business days to reach the payee. The payment will typically reach the payee one business day after the debit posts to our account. All payments must be released by 5:00pm ET to be processed that day. Payments released after 5:00pm ET will be processed the following day.

Below represents approximate payment timing:

| Payment Released                          | Payee Receives      | Status       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| <p></p><p>Monday before 5:00pm</p><p></p> | Friday Morning\*    | 12312        |
| Tuesday before 5:00pm                     | Monday Morning      | 123123       |
| Wednesday before 5:00pm                   | Tuesday Morning     | 23123        |
| Thursday before 5:00pm                    | Wednesday Morning\* | 123123       |
| Friday before 5:00pm                      | Thursday Morning    | 123123123123 |

_\* Factors at receiving banks may delay timing._ All times in Eastern Time (ET) and represent approximate deadlines.

#### Why is my ACH payment not available for release? <a href="#why-is-my-ach-payment-not-available-for-release" id="why-is-my-ach-payment-not-available-for-release"></a>

Below are common reasons why a payment is not available for release. You may also refer to Payee Payments > Release Payments > Not Ready for Release > Reason for specific information related to your payment. Here are a few of the most common reasons:

* The vendor hasn't been onboarded into Automate Payments as a valid payee
  * Transactions will only flow to Automate for vendors that have been onboarded as a Payee. Follow the [import payee process](https://docs.squareworks.com/squareworks-automate/automate-configuration/payment-automation#id-9.-importing-payees) to invite your payee and add and approve a payment method.
* The GL account on the bill payment is not linked to a funding source within Automate
  * To resolve this, please follow the steps [here ](https://docs.squareworks.com/squareworks-automate/automate-configuration/payment-automation#toc146619847)to link bank accounts. Then, void and re-create your bill payment.
* The payee has not completed the invite to provide payment information or you have not approved the supplied payment method.
  * Review the Payee and re-send the invite to remind the Payee to complete their information or approve the payment method provided
* The payment is over the maximum allowed amount.
  * Currently payments are limited to $500,000. If you need to pay a payee more than the maximum allowed amount, you can split into separate bill payments.
* The payment is not in a supported currency
  * Currently all payments must be in US Dollar.

#### How do you connect to my Bank to initiate ACH Transactions? Do I have to provide you login details? <a href="#how-do-you-connect-to-my-bank-to-initiate-ach-transactions-do-i-have-to-provide-you-login-details" id="how-do-you-connect-to-my-bank-to-initiate-ach-transactions-do-i-have-to-provide-you-login-details"></a>

The Payment Automation feature uses ACH debits to pull money from your account when you release an ACH payment batch. There is no need to provide us with your bank login credentials. To ensure funds can be debited from your account, please verify that your bank account allows ACH debit transactions from Originator ID "945440567\_". **The underscore represents a mandatory blank space that must be present at the end of the ID number.**

#### Do I have to use a specific bank with Payment Automation? <a href="#do-i-have-to-use-a-specific-bank-with-payment-automation" id="do-i-have-to-use-a-specific-bank-with-payment-automation"></a>

The Payment Automation feature does not require you to open an account with a particular bank. In most cases, you can connect directly to your existing account. We do have the two following requirements for your bank/account:

* The bank must be a US based bank

#### How can I cancel a pending ACH payment? <a href="#how-can-i-cancel-a-pending-ach-payment" id="how-can-i-cancel-a-pending-ach-payment"></a>

If a payment is released by mistake, you have up to 1 minute to 'Cancel Selected' outstanding payments using the 'Release in Process' table found in the 'Release Payments' table.

If it's been longer than 1 minute and the payment (ACH Credit) hasn't settled yet (less than 4-5 business days) you should reach out to our team at netsuite-support@squareworks.com with the transaction ID to request a cancellation.

You can file for an ACH Reversal up to 4 business days after the ACH credit settlement date if there was a duplicate payment, incorrect amount, or incorrect vendor bank account number. You must reach out to your team at netsuite-support@squareworks.com and provide more details around the reason for the request.

No, the balance will not automatically transfer back to your business entity's bank account. You must manually initiate the transfer in Squareworks Automate by navigating to Balance Transfers > Release Transfers > New Transfer, selecting the Business Entity and Funding Source, and withdrawing the balance.
